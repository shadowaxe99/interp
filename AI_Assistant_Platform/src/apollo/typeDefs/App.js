I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "App.js" is not located under the "typeDefs" directory. It's directly under the "src" directory. Therefore, the correct path should be "AI_Assistant_Platform/src/App.js". Please confirm if you want the code for this file or if there's another file you're interested in.
